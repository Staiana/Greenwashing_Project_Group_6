This project investigates the effects of greenwashing accusations on stock prices through a difference-in-differences (Diff-in-Diff) approach. The research includes comprehensive data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and regression models to understand the market reactions to such accusations.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- **Paper**
  - `Green_lies_and_market_cries.pdf`: The research paper detailing our findings.
- **Notebooks**
  - `Groupe_6_REME.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and initial methodological steps.
- **Scripts**
  - `Groupe_6.do`: Stata Do-file for additional descriptive analysis and our regression models.
- **Data**
  - `acc_data.csv`: Initial dataset containing the manually scared accusations for the Jupyter notebook.
  - `final_df.csv`: Final dataset used in the Stata Do-file.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have the following software installed:
